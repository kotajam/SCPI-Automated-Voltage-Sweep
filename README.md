# SCPI-Automated-Voltage-Sweep
ABSTRACT: 
This project utilizes a direct multimeter and power supply to conduct an automated voltage sweep. Its tasks include automating a voltage-sweeping system, storing the recorded values of current and voltage, creating an I-V chart with these values to verify Ohm's Law, and comparing our measured values to calculated values to observe accuracy. This project utilizes SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) to communicate with the test instruments using common syntax such as "VOLTAGE OUTPUT ON." Both programmable instruments were manufactured by Keystone Instruments. This code was made with MATLAB 2023 syntax and functions.
